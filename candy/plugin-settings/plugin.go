// Package settings is the charly plugin OWNING the externalized `charly settings` command — the
// runtime-configuration get/set/list/path/reset surface. The plugin owns BOTH the subcommand
// grammar/output AND the config subsystem itself (config.go, wave γ): read/write
// ~/.config/charly/config.yml (GetConfigValue/SetConfigValue/ListConfigValues/ResetConfigValue/
// hostenv.RuntimeConfigPath) is pure host-env file I/O; the credential-store touches (vnc.password.*,
// secret_backend) + runtime-engine resolution dispatch verb:credential / call sdk/kit directly. No
// core round-trip — the former generic "settings" HostBuild seam is retired.
//
// settings is COMPILED-IN (charly.yml compiled_plugins): its Invoke(OpRun) (provider.go) runs in
// charly's process and gets the in-proc reverse channel that dispatchInProcCommand threads (Seam A),
// giving InvokeProvider capability for the credential-touching ops. The out-of-process placement
// fork/execs the binary → CliMain, which has NO reverse channel; CliMain refuses unconditionally
// (never partially works) rather than exposing a silently narrower out-of-process capability set —
// settings' supported, tested placement stays compiled-in-only, exactly as before this cutover.
// NewProvider()/NewMeta()/CliMain are the standard dual-mode command shape (mirror
// candy/plugin-migrate + command:clean); NewMeta advertises command:settings so the compiled-in
// registry path (registerCompiledPlugin → resolve(ClassCommand,"settings") → dispatchInProcCommand)
// dispatches it.
